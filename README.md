# Testimonial Card

This tiny project helped me revise some frontend fundamentals after a longer break.  
I focused on:

- **Responsive Design** — using breakpoints for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Box Model** — understanding how margin, border, padding, and content work together.
- **Flexbox** — building layouts with alignment, spacing, and flexible containers.

The result is a simple, centered testimonial card component that adapts nicely to different screen sizes.

Built with plain **HTML** + **CSS** for revision and frontend interview preparation.
